### Task 3
***
We selected the project elasticsearch and will be looking at its framework along with it its UI and API components.

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
   <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
   <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
The code mentioned above was written by the coders and added in the pom.xml file for testing purposes. API testing is done using JUnit and elasticsearch test framework. Node ann indices are made using elasticsearch classes. The main classes for testing are ESTestcase and ESTokenStrameTestcase. ESIntechTestcase is used for integration testing. ESIntechTestcase.client() is used for getting a random a client. Some other methods to access the client can be accessed by ESIntechTestcase.internalcluster() method. For example masterclient(), nonmasterclient(), and clientnodeClient(). 

In order to test the code with every possible data, the class randomizetest is used. It offers several methods. It is the randomizedtestrunner which by default uses a random seed to create psuedo randomness. This seed can be reused on test runs.

In order to check for assertions, elasticsearchassertions and elasticsearchgeoassertions classes are used.  

**Elasticsearch testing framework**
End points can be accessed as follows:
```
Elasticsearch: https://localhost:9200
Kibana: https://localhost:5601
User: elastic
Password:Â changeme
```

**Package Testing:**

Vagarant is used for package testing. Vagarantfile is present in the root of elasticsearch repository. This file contains more than a dozen different operating systems that need to be supported. In the testing packages, the testing itself is done using bats i.e bash-automated-testing-system

An example of this is as follows:
```
@test "[$GROUP] install a sample plugin from a directory with a space" {
    rm -rf "/tmp/plugins with space"
    mkdir -p "/tmp/plugins with space"
    local zip=$(ls $BATS_PLUGINS/custom-settings-*.zip)
    local zipname=$(basename $zip)
    cp $zip "/tmp/plugins with space"

    install_plugin_example "/tmp/plugins with space/$zipname"
    remove_plugin_example
}
```
