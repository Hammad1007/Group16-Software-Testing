### Task 3
***
We selected the project elasticsearch and will be looking at its framework along with it its UI and API components.

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
   <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
   <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
The code mentioned above was written by the coders and added in the pom.xml file for testing purposes. API testing is done using JUnit and elasticsearch test framework. Node ann indices are made using elasticsearch classes. The main classes for testing are ESTestcase and ESTokenStrameTestcase.
