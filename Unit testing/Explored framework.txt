Base class for unit testing = ESTestCase
It has many annotations in which the most important one is the LuceneTestCase class.
This class also has many annotations. @Runwith annotation is most important.
It's the runner for Junit (class which decides how the tests are run). It is an implementation
for running randomized test cases with predictable and repeatable randomness.
The test class is equipping us with a couple of methods that allows us to create random data. (random integer,
random boolean, etc). 
It helps us in testing too to get random data.
When we run the tests, if a failure accurs, the framework provides us with a seed value which is mentioned
in the test failure.
ESTestCase has thread leak detection, log level vchanges, checks for excessive err/sysout writes,
test method order is also randomized (no test will be dependent on any test before, all tests run independently),
tests can run in parallel, hence, avoid paralyzation.  


ESSingleNodeTestCase is a derived class from ESTestCase which will help us in testing the framework by
ourselves.
