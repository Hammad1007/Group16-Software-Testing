**README**
The name of the project which we will be doing is Testing and Test Automation of Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Testing of Terraform code)

Procedure:
The people at Gruntworks have developed a new tool called Terratest. The goal is to make Terraform code testable by using a unit testing framework. They chose to use Goâ€™s unit testing framework (they could have picked anything) then developed Go libraries that performed common tasks like SSH-ing into a machine.
