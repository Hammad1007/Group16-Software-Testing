System Reliablitiy testing using Chaos Engineering


Definition: Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.

Background: 
Netflix allowed chaos engineering to take root. Netflix was finding many bugs and edge cases. Netflix started a service called "Chaps Monkey". In the real world, disruptions happen at random time e.g., server gets down. Chaos Monkey randomly broke off Virtual Machine containers or instances when the code is still in production.
This helped cater the above mentioned problem so there won't be issues in the actual application. In this way, netflix team started to build more fault tolerant solutions. Chaos Monkey ensured reliability.
